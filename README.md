# GitHub User and Repository Data Collection - Sydney

- This project gathers data from the GitHub API on Sydney-based users with high follower counts and their public repositories.
- Data analysis shows that specific programming languages and well-documented repositories tend to engage more users; some users manage hundreds of repositories, showing strong community involvement.
- Developers might increase their visibility and follower count on GitHub by prioritizing clear and organized documentation.

## Overview

This project focuses on collecting and analyzing GitHub data for users in Sydney with over 100 followers, including their public repository details. The collected information is stored in two main files for straightforward analysis:
1. **users.csv** - Includes fields such as `login`, `name`, `company`, `bio`, and follower count.
2. **repositories.csv** - Contains repository details like `full_name`, `language`, stars, and licensing information.

The data helps analyze trends in open-source contributions in Sydney, shedding light on the characteristics of highly followed GitHub users.
